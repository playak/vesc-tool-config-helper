# BALANCE v0.0.3

Balance package. This is a first attempt based on the balance app just to get started. It compiles and loads, but is completely untested. All settings are there and there is also a QML-file that can be extended.

Most things should be similar to the regular balance app, except some of the time measurements as they are mostly based on seconds now. If there are problems when testing I would check the time measurements first.
