# FLOAT PACKAGE

A balance vehicle package specifically tailored for one wheeled skateboards, as invented by Ben Smither in 2007: http://www.robosys.co.uk/

Includes all the basics such as PID control, ATR, and Turntilt - but also has popular features such as remote support,  dirty landings, push start, and many more. See help text in the tool/app for details on any feature.

Now includes Quicksaves in the AppUI!

<H3><font color=yellow>NEW USERS: DO NOT LOAD UNTIL YOU'VE CONFIGURED MOTOR AND IMU!!!</font></H3>

After loading do not forget to configure your details in the Specs tab: voltages and ADC values (default assumes 15s pack and 3.0V ADC cutoffs).

Once you've adjusted your voltages the default tune should provide you with a well behaving, rideable board. If it acts weird it's most likely a motor configuration or IMU calibration issue!

This package is not endorsed by the vesc-project. Use at your own risk.

<H2>CREDITS</H2>

Based on Mitch Lustig's original Balance Package, but specifically tailored for one wheeled skateboards.

Ported by Nico Aleman, heavily based on SurfDado's ATR Firmware: https://pev.dev/t/atr-firmware-101/43

Removed unneeded parameters, added new features and behaviors and a more user-friendly configuration menu with usable default/min/max values and informative Help text.
